# Overview

For the third part of the series, first, we will add a module that will generate test data. Then, we will use the generated test data to test the `api/create-client` route. The `api/create-client` route expects to receive a **POST** request with the following data structure for a submitted client in the request body:

```javascript
{
  name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  address: { type: String, required: false },
  phone: { type: Number, required: false },
  company: { type: String, required: false },
  notes: { type: String, required: false }
}
```

In the previous code snippet, note that the `name` and `email` properties are the only required values and that the `name` property must be unique from other submitted client data objects. Once the request is submitted and successfully saved to the database, the API responds with a `200` status code and a message: **"(name) sucessfully added"**. If there is an error with the request, the API sends back a `400` status code and the associated error. Lastly, if a duplicate client is submitted, the API sends back a `409` status with the message: **"(name) is already in use"**.

# Generating Dynamic Test Data

Instead of hard-coding test data, we will install and use [javafaker](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.javafaker/javafaker) to automatically create test data for use before each test run. We can install the latest Maven version by adding it as a dependency to our `pom.xml`:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.javafaker/javafaker -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.javafaker</groupId>
    <artifactId>javafaker</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Next, we'll configure the module in our `karate-config.js` file:

```javascript
function fn() {
  var fakerClass = Java.type('com.github.javafaker.Faker')
  var faker = new fakerClass()
  var fakeUser = {
    name: faker.name().fullName(),
    email: faker.internet().emailAddress(),
    phone: parseInt(faker.number().digits(10), 10),
    address: faker.address().fullAddress(),
    company: faker.company().name(),
    notes: faker.company().catchPhrase(),
  }

  var config = {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api/',
    fakeUser: fakeUser,
  }
  return config
}
```

We created the variable `fakerClass` in the previous code and used [Java.type](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/prog_guide/javascript.html#A1147187) to access the Java module in our JavaScript file. Then, we used `fakerfaker` methods to auto-generate data for each object property. Finally, we added the `fakeUser` variable to our `config` object, making it available to any of our feature test files.

# Testing the api/add-client Endpoint

We will verify that a POST request to `api/add-client` returns a `200` status code and the message, **"(name) successfully added"**. The "**(name)"** will display the `name` property for the submitted client object. First, let's create a feature file with the following:

```gherkin
Feature: Create Client

  Scenario: A user can create a client
    Given url baseUrl
    And path 'add-client'
    And request fakeUser
    When method POST
    Then status 200
    And assert response.message == fakeUser.name + " successfully added"
```

In the previous code, we created a test that submitted a **POST** request to `api/add-client` using the `fakeUser` data generator. Then, we verified the submission was successful with a `200` status and message **"(name) successfully added"** returned from the API. Notice how we could access the `message` property off the response body using the unique `response` variable from Karate. The `response` variable is another valuable feature in Karate to have when creating test cases. Finally, when we run the test, we receive a report indicating the test passed as expected:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="Add Create Cucumber Report"
    src="/static/images/create_client_report.png"
    width={900}
    height={400}
  />
</div>

Note that in the previous screenshot, we are viewing a detailed page of the Cucumber Report that displays the outcome for each test step.

## Verify Duplicate Clients Cannot Be Submitted

For our next test, we will verify that duplicate clients cannot be created:

```gherkin
Feature: Create Client
  Background:
    * def getClients = call read('get-clients.feature')
    * def clientList = getClients.response.clients
    * def getLastClient = clientList[clientList.length - 1]

  Scenario: A user cannot create a duplicate client
    Given url baseUrl
    And path 'add-client'
    And request getLastClient
    When method POST
    Then status 409
    And assert response.message == getLastClient.name + " is already in use"
```

In the previous code, first, we used `Background` to create variables to use in the test `Scenario`. Then, the `getClients` variable uses the Karate [call](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate#call) and [read](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate#reading-files) actions to run the `get-clients.feature` and store the response result. In other words, we call one API and use the result to set up a call to another API. Karate makes it a breeze to use the response from one API call to another one. Next, we store the `clients` array from the previous API call in the `clientList` variable. Then, we store the last client object in the array in the variable `getLastClient`.

Inside the scenario, we attempt to create a new client using the `getLastClient` data and expect a `409` status code and message **"(client) is already in use"**. When we run the test, we get the following report indicating the test passed as expected:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="Duplicate Client Cucumber Report"
    src="/static/images/duplicate_client_report.png"
    width={900}
    height={500}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we see that the test `duplicate-client.feature` passes.

# Part 3 Review

In review, we updated our framework by including a module to auto-generate test data. Next, we created a `POST` request to verify the `api/add-client` route. Finally, we learned how to use the response from one API call to setup and call another API. Next, we will learn how to test the **POST** `api/update-client` and `api/get-client` routes.
