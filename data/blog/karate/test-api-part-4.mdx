# Overview

In the fourth part of the series, we will test the `api/get-client` and `api/update-client` routes and learn how to create feature files that accept dynamic data.

# Testing the api/get-client Endpoint

We will verfiy that a **GET** request to `api/get-client` with a user's `id` returns a `200` status. We can create a feature file with the following:

```gherkin
Feature: Get Client

  Background:
    * def getClients = call read('get-clients.feature')
    * def clientList = getClients.response.clients
    * def getLastClient = clientList[clientList.length - 1]

  Scenario: A user can get a single client
    Given url baseUrl
    And path 'get-client'
    And param id = getLastClient.id
    When method GET
    Then status 200
```

We stored the last client in the variable `getLastClient` via a call to `api/clients` in the previous code, similar to what we did in Part 3. Inside the `Scenario`, we used the Karate [param](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate#param) keyword to pass an `id` parameter equal to the `id` of the object stored in `getLastClient`. When we run the test, we receive a report indicating the test passed:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="Get Client Cucumber Report"
    src="/static/images/get_client_report.png"
    width={900}
    height={550}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we see that the test `get-client.feature` passes as expected.

# Testing the api/update-client Endpoint

For our next test, we will verify that a **POST** request to `api/update-client` returns a `201` status and the message **"(client) successfully updated"**. We will create a feature file with the following:

```gherkin
Feature: Update Client

  Background:
    * def getClients = call read('get-clients.feature')
    * def clientList = getClients.response.clients
    * def getLastClient = clientList[clientList.length - 1]
    * def newEmail = fakeUser.email

  Scenario: A user can update client data
    Given url baseUrl
    And path 'update-client'
    And getLastClient.email = newEmail
    And request getLastClient
    When method POST
    Then status 201
    And response.message == getLastClient.name + " successfully updated"
    And path 'get-client'
    And param id = getLastClient.id
    When method GET
    Then response.email == newEmail
```

In the previous code, inside `Background`, we created variables similar to the last test in this blog. In addition, we created a `newEmail` variable and set it equal to the `email` property of our `fakeUser` data generator. We will use this variable to update the `email` property of the `getLastClient` data object. Inside the `Scenario`, we make a **POST** request to `update-client` with the `email` from `getLastClient` updated to our new `email` value. Once the request is made, we assert that the `response` `status` and `message` values are correct.

Finally, we make a **GET** request to `get-client` using the `id` and access the response body to verify that the `email` property is equal to the value used to update the client data object. When we run the test, we receive a report indicating the test passed:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="Update Client Cucumber Report"
    src="/static/images/update_client_report.png"
    width={900}
    height={600}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we see that the test `update-client.feature` passes.

# Another Option to Test api/update-client

Notice in the previous test that we explicitly called `get-client` to verify the `email` property was updated as expected. We could have cleaned up our code a bit by changing the way the **"get-client"** feature file accepts an `id` and using the [call](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate#call) and [read](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate#reading-files) actions to make the request and receive the `response` in the **"update-client"** feature file. To illustrate, first, we will modify the **"Get Client"** feature file to the following:

```gherkin
Feature: Get Client

Background:
  * def getClients = call read('get-clients.feature')
  * def clientList = getClients.response.clients
  * def getLastClient = clientList[clientList.length - 1]
Scenario: A user can get a single client
  Given url baseUrl
  And path 'get-client'
  And params {id: #(id)}
  When method GET
  Then status 200
```

In the previous code, we updated [param](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate#param) to "params" and passed in an object representing the query `id` and associated value to use in the request. The Karate [params](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate#params) allow us to pass multiple query parameters to a request, including dynamic query parameters. Next, we will modify the **"Update Client"** feature:

```gherkin
Feature: Update Client

  Background:
    * def getClients = call read('get-clients.feature')
    * def clientList = getClients.response.clients
    * def getLastClient = clientList[clientList.length - 1]
    * def newEmail = fakeUser.email

  Scenario: A user can update client data
    Given url baseUrl
    And path 'update-client'
    And getLastClient.email = newEmail
    And request getLastClient
    When method POST
    Then status 201
    And response.message == getLastClient.name + " successfully updated"
    * def id = getLastClient.id
    And call read('get-client.feature') {id: #(id)}
    Then response.email == newEmail
```

In the previous code, first, we created an `id` variable set to the `id` of the `getLastClient` client object. Then we run the **"Get Client"** feature and pass in a dynamic `id` parameter for the feature to consume. When we run the test, we receive a report indicating the test passed:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="Dynamic Update Client Cucumber Report"
    src="/static/images/dynamic_update_client_report.png"
    width={900}
    height={700}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we see that the test `update-client.feature` continues to pass. Essentially, we updated the feature to chain multiple API tests including **"Get Clients"**, **"Update Client"** and **"Get Client"**.

# Part 4 Review

In review, we tested the `api/get-client` and `api/update-client` routes. We also learned how to create dynamic feature files by passing data to feature files.
Next, we will learn how to test the **DELETE** `api/delete-client` route.
