# Overview

In the fifth part of the series, we will test the **DELETE** `api/delete-client` route.

# Testing the api/delete-client Endpoint

We will verify that a **DELETE** request to `api/delete-client` with a user's `id` and `name` returns a `200` status and the message **"(name) successfully deleted".** We can create a feature file with the following:

```gherkin
Feature: Delete Client

  Background:
    * def getClients = call read('get-clients.feature')
    * def clientList = getClients.response.clients
    * def getLastClient = clientList[clientList.length - 1]
    * def userId = getLastClient.id
    * def userName = getLastClient.name

  Scenario: A user can delete a client
    Given url baseUrl
    And path 'delete-client'
    And request { id: "#(userId)", name: "#(userName)" }
    When method DELETE
    Then status 200
    And response.message == getLastClient.name + " successfully deleted"
```

In the previous code, we created a `userId` and `userName` variable along with variables we've seen in previous tests in the series to access the last client in the database. Inside the `Scenario`, we pass in the `userId` variable as the value for `id` and `userName` variable as the value for `name`. When we run the test, we receive a report indicating the test passed:

<div className="text-center">

    src="/static/images/delete_client_report.png"
    width={900}
    height={500}
  />
</div>

The previous screenshot indicates that the test passed with the correct status code and response message.

# Part 5 Review

In review, we tested the `api/delete-client` by accessing the last client added to the database via the **"Get Clients"** feature, passed in the `id` and `name` properties from the data object. Finally, we verified the API returned the correct status code and message.
