# Overview

I recently did a podcast with my employer, Method, about the journey from teaching to my current role as a Test Engineer and how I managed to publish a book while learning how to be a first-time father to my newborn son. The following image is me and my assistant (aka my son ðŸ‘¶) hard at work:

The journey was very challenging but rewarding at the same time. I hope my story will inspire others to achieve their own unique goals.
