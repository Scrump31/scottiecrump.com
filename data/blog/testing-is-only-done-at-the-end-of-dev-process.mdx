# Intro

A common myth about software testing is that it's only done at the end of the development process. Fortunately, this isn't the case. Instead, testing should be an integral part of the development process and start early. This blog will dispel this myth and explore the importance of testing throughout the software development process.

# The Value of Early Testing

The sooner you start testing, the better. There are many reasons for this. First and foremost, it will expose errors in your code before they become big problems. Also, it reduces the number of bugs that you have to fix. When you're able to catch errors early in the process, you can fix them right then and there and move on. When you're forced to fix bugs at the end of the process, they usually become more complex and require extra time and effort. Examples of early testing include:

- Analyzing designs
- Verifying user stories is not vague and includes testable acceptance criteria
- Using code linters to test code statically.

Another reason to use early testing is that it allows you to get quick feedback that you can use to improve the quality of your software. For example, automated tests and code reviews are great ways to gain rapid feedback to fix issues before code merges. In addition, when you test early, it will help you meet deadlines. If you wait until the end of the process to start testing, you might find yourself in a situation where you're rushed and don't have enough time to test your software thoroughly. As a result, you may release low-quality software.

# The Value of a Tester in the Development Process

Testers can help teams avoid potential bugs by performing testing activities such as analyzing requirements for issues before the first line of code is written. For example, the tester can raise questions such as:

- Does the design of a feature make sense?
- Does the feature fit in with the rest of the product?
- Are we confident users will understand how to use this feature?
- Are there any potential issues we haven't considered in the current design?

Questions like the above often encourage the team to consider whether a feature is unlikely to be useful or well-received and make relevant changes.
Testers can work with the team to help them understand how a change in the design of a feature might impact the usability of the software. For example, A new feature version might be more challenging to use than the current version. Changing how a feature works or is displayed on the screen might make it more or less easy to use. A new feature might require users to perform a task they are unfamiliar with or not used to performing. Testers can ask questions to assist the team in thinking about how users will react to changes and potential issues.
Testers can also help teams identify "high-risk" areas of the product where changes are likely to impact users. For example, a change in how data is stored might affect performance or security.

# Summary

In summary, testing should not be viewed as something done at the end of the development process but rather as a continuous, essential part of the development process. The sooner you start testing, the better. It will expose errors in your code, reduce the number of bugs you have to fix, help avoid potential problems, and ultimately increase the quality of the software.
