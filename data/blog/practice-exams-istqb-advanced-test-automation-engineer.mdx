Correct Answer:

The correct answer is "**Compare and validate that the automated script performs the same test as the manual script it replaces.**"

When transitioning from manual to automated testing, it is important to compare and validate that the automated script performs the same test as the manual script it replaces. This ensures that the automated tests are accurate and reliable.

The other answer choices are not recommended practices when transitioning from manual to automated testing.

"**Automate all existing manual tests without evaluation**" is not a recommended practice, as it is important to evaluate the manual tests before automating them to ensure that they are worth automating.

"**Rely solely on automated tests and eliminate all manual tests**" is not a recommended practice, as it is important to have a mix of manual and automated tests. Manual tests can be used to verify the results of automated tests and to test areas that are difficult to automate.

"**Use the same tools for manual and automated testing**" is not a recommended practice, as it is important to use tools that are specifically designed for automated testing. Manual testing tools are not designed to support the same level of automation as automated testing tools.
