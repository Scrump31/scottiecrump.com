# Intro

ECMA2016, also known as ES7 syntax, consists of just two new features compared to the massive number of features introduced in ES6. The new features are: `Array.prototype.includes()` and the **Exponential operator** `**`.

# Array.prototype.includes()

This new function can be used when you want to know if specific values exist inside an array. Array.prototype.indexOf() is another previously available method to achieve this functionality, but the new ES7 Array.prototype.includes() method has a cleaner syntax. We can illustrate the differences with a few examples:

## Previously Available Method

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers.indexOf(2) > -1) // true
console.log(numbers.indexOf(10) > -1) // false
```

## ES7

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers.includes(2)) // true
console.log(numbers.includes(10)) // false
```

It is easy to see that using the new ES7 syntax is a cleaner solution to find a specific value in an array.

# Exponential operator (\*\*)

This new function can be used when you want to calculate exponents. Math.pow() is another previously available method to achieve this functionality, but the new ES7 \*\* is a cleaner syntax. We can illustrate the differences with a few examples:

## Previously Available Method

```js
const twoCubed = Math.pow(2, 3)
console.log(twoCubed) // 8
```

## ES7

```js
const twoCubed = 2 ** 3
console.log(twoCubed) // 8
```

Again, it is easy to see that using the new ES7 syntax is a cleaner solution to return the exponential value of a number.

# Conclusion

Well, there you have it! Two new methods in your toolset to write cleaner code and get the job done easier. ðŸ˜ƒ
