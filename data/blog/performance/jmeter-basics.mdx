# Overview

[Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) is an open-sourced popular tool used to
execute [Performance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing) for applications. If the
success of your business weighs heavily on how well your application handles increased numbers of users, then
Performance testing should be an essential piece of your testing strategy. For example, e-commerce websites typically
experience large numbers of users during Black Friday sales. As a result, those businesses could lose millions of
dollars if their applications lack the design to handle increased loads to complete sales transactions. This blog will
cover the basics of using JMeter by designing and executing a test plan against a Computer database application. Next,
we will review the application to test.

# Computer Database App Overview

The [Computer Database](https://computer-database.gatling.io/computers) application we will use to execute Performance
testing allows users to display filtered computers by name:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="filtered computer database results"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/filtered-computer-results.png"
    width={700}
    height={400}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, search results display all computers that include the name **"Acer."** Users can also add
new computers or edit current computers:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="edit computer form"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/edit-computer.png"
    width={600}
    height={400}
  />
</div>

The previous screenshot displays a form that allows users to update details for the **"Acer Extensa"** computer. Next,
we will assess the application's responsiveness when many concurrent users complete actions to edit a computer.

# Overview of the Load Profile to Create

A load profile consists of the number of virtual users accessing an application, the operations completed, and their
intensity while navigating the site. For example, the **"edit a computer"** operations our virtual users will execute
consist of four steps:

- First, navigate to the site.
- Second, enter a computer name and click the **"Filter by name"** button.
- Third, select the computer to edit from the filtered list.
- Lastly, edit details and submit the form.

We will test the application with 50 concurrent users for our test plan (Note: significantly higher numbers of users
would be used for testing in real-life production applications). In addition, we will add specific delays to requests to
mimic real-life behaviors when users need time to think before completing actions. Also, we will assert the expected
response code in the server's output. Finally, we will generate reports to analyze and understand how the application
responded to the load.

# Installing JMeter

Before running tests with JMeter, we first need to install it. The Apache JMeter site
provides [download instructions](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) for the latest version. You also need at
least [Java version 8](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) installed on your machine to use JMeter.
After installing JMeter, we can create and execute our test plan. Navigate to the **bin** folder where JMeter is
installed and use `sh jmeter.sh` in the terminal to open JMeter. You can also create
an [alias to open JMeter](https://loadfocus.com/blog/2021/06/how-to-create-an-alias-to-easily-start-jmeter-on-your-local-machine/#:~:text=Create%20an%20alias%20to%20the,1%2Fbin%2Fjmeter%22)
using one command quickly from anywhere in your system. Finally, we can use an additional tool to lessen creating our
test plan in JMeter. In the next section, we will learn how to use BlazeMeter to speed up building our JMeter test plan.

# Implementing The Test Plan with BlazeMeter

[BlazeMeter](https://www.blazemeter.com/) eases the creation of our test plan in JMeter by allowing you to record
actions as you use the application in the browser and convert the outcome into a file that JMeter understands. To use
BlazeMeter, first, install the
associated [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blazemeter-the-continuous/mbopgmdnpcbohhpnfglgohlbhfongabi?hl=en)
and create a free account. Next, log into your BlazeMeter account, start a recording session, navigate to the site in
the Chrome browser, perform actions to edit a computer, save the recording as a JMX file, and finally, import the JMX
file into JMeter.

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="blazeMeter record screen"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/blazemeter-screenshot.png"
    width={800}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we see a snippet of BlazeMeter recording actions on the site in the browser. In the
following sections, we will learn about the JMeter elements created by our recorded script using BlazeMeter.

## Understanding Thread Groups

[Thread Groups](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#thread_group) represent a specific number of users
to access the software under test (SUT). BlazeMeter includes one user (i.e., thread) in the generated script by default.
We will update the users to the desired number of 50. In addition, we will specify how often to add new threads every
second using the **Ramp-up period**. We will use 10, meaning we want all users added in ten seconds. JMeter will add
users in increments of 5 every second since (50 users / 10 ramp-up seconds) = five users per second. Lastly, we
configure the thread to run once by specifying the **Loop Count** as 1:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter thread-group configuration"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/thread-group.png"
    width={800}
    height={400}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we updated the number of concurrent users to 50, The Ramp-up to 10, and Loop Count to 1.

## Understanding Controllers

[Controllers](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#controllers) allow us to group requests in folders and
can also be used to control the processing order of the request URLs we visit. There are various controllers we can use
in JMeter based on needs. For example, BlazeMeter grouped our requests inside the **"Transaction Controller"** that we
labeled as **"edit computer details."** The **"Transaction Controller"** adds an extra section to the test results,
which measures the overall time to perform all requests nested in the folder:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter transaction controller window"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/controller.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we see the **"Name"** and **"Comments"** fields and selected checkboxes for **"Generate
parent sample"** and **"Include duration of timer and pre-post processors in generated sample."** By selecting **"
Generate parent sample,"** the test results will only show the parent folder for all requests in the test results report
versus displaying each request individually. By selecting **"Include duration of timer and pre-post processors in
generated sample,"** test results will include artificially added time (e.g., think time) to the request via JMeter
Timers. We will better understand the checkbox values in a later section in the blog.

## Understanding Samplers

[Samplers](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#samplers) represent the URL of the server you want to
test. BlazeMeter automatically created samplers for every webpage we visited in the recording, labeled them with the URL
used in the request, and stored them inside the **"edit computer details"** controller:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter samplers window unedited"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/unedited-samplers.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

To make the samplers clear, we will edit the sampler names:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter samplers window edited"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/edited-samplers.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

We edited all the sampler names in the previous screenshot to provide more context to the specific step. For the
currently selected **"navigate to site"** sampler, notice the value `${BASE_URL_1}` for **"Server Name or IP"** inside
the **"Web Server"** section of the **"HTTP Request"** window. The value is a variable created in the **"User Defined
Variables"** added to our test plan by BlazeMeter. The **"User Defined Variables"** is an example of
many [Configuration Elements](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#config_elements) we can add
to our Test plan via right-clicking on the test plan (i.e., demo) and selecting **Add -> Config Element**:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter user defined variables window"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/user-defined-variables.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we see the **"Name"** and **"Value"** for our `${BASE_URL_1}` variable. The benefit of using
a variable is that if the value ever changes, it only needs to be updated in one location versus every instance where
the value is used. Also, inside the **"HTTP Request"** window, we can set many other values for the request. For
example, we can set the request method with **"HTTP Request,"** the **"Path"** value, and even the HTTP protocol.

## Understanding Timers

When users interact with applications, it is customary to complete specific actions such as filling out sign up forms.
The extra time needed to do particular activities is known as "think time." We can mimic think time in JMeter
using [Timers](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#timers). The first JMeter timer we will add is "\*
_Constant Time."** The **"Constant Timer"\*\* executes a hard-coded delay before each request. For example, we can add a _
\*"Constant Timer"** for the **"search for computer"** and **"select result"\*\* samplers:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter constant timer window"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/constant-timer.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

We added a **"Thread Delay"** of 1000 milliseconds (i.e., 1 second) for the two noted samplers in the previous
screenshot. For the **"edit and save"** sampler, we will use the **"Uniform Random Timer."** The **"Uniform Random
Timer"** allows you to add random delays to requests:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter uniform random timer window"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/uniform-random-timer.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

We added a **"Random Delay Maximum"** of 4000 milliseconds and a **"Constant Delay Offset"** of 1500 milliseconds in the
previous screenshot. The values added mean there will be a delay between one and a half and four seconds before the
sampler completes.

## Understanding Listeners

We need to create reports to analyze and understand the application's performance after test runs. JMeter provides
many [listeners](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#listeners) to display test run data in various
ways. We will add two listeners:

- View Results Tree
- Aggregate Report

The **"View Results Tree"** listener is suitable to view the request and response data and assertion results while
running JMeter via the graphical user interface (GUI). Note that the **"View Results Tree"** listener is not ideal for
production because it provides non-aggregated data, so remember to remove it before running JMeter via the command line.
The **"Aggregate Report"** listener is suitable to view essential performance data such as the average response time and
throughput:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter listeners"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/listeners.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we can see all the listeners added to the test plan nested in the Thread Group.

## Adding Assertions

We can add [assertions](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#assertions) to verify expected responses
from the server. For each request, we will confirm the response returns a 200 status code:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter response code assertion"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/assertions.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

We added an assertion to each request in the previous screenshot verifying that the **"Response Code"** equals 200.

## Running the Test Plan from the GUI

To see how our test plan runs and to debug, we can click the "start button" inside the GUI:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="jMeter GUI test run"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/start-button.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, the green "start button" is highlighted. Once the test run finishes, we can view reporting
data generated in our listeners. Note: for demonstration purposes, the following examples use ten users. For example,
the "View Results Tree" data is as follows:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="view results tree report"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/view-results-tree-results.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we see ten rows representing all ten users accessing the site. In an earlier section, **"
Understanding Controllers,"** we selected the **"Generate parent sample"** checkbox. By checking that box, we first see
the parent **"edit computer details"** and have to click into it to see the individual requests. Nested inside each row
is response information for each page request. Next, we can look at **"Aggregate Report"** data:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="aggregate report"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/aggregate-report.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

In the previous screenshot, we see the test data represented in **"Aggregate Report."** Notable data is **"Average,"**
meaning the average time for requests to complete, and **"Throughput,"** representing the number of requests the server
can handle per minute. In an earlier section, **"Understanding Controllers,"** we selected the **"Include duration of
timer and pre-post processors in generated sample"** checkbox. By checking that box, our test results include values
from the delays calculated in specific requests. So, for example, we could use the data to report that the application
can tolerate 38.5 requests a second at an average of six seconds to completion for the "edit a computer" scenario.

## Running the Test Plan from the Command-line

We can run JMeter tests via the GUI. However, it is best to run via the command line because the GUI consumes a lot of
system memory, making tests run slowly. On a Mac or Linux machine, navigate to the **"bin"** folder where you have
JMeter installed and use the following command to run JMeter (run the `jmeter.bat` for Windows users):

```bash
sh jmeter.sh -n -t "location of your .jmx test file here" -l "location of the file to log results - ex. results.csv"
```

In the previous code snippet, we ran JMeter passing in parameters:

- `-n` means non-GUI mode
- `-t` means the path to test file
- `-l` means the location of the file to log the results

Note that the file used to log test results will automatically be created by JMeter if it does not already exist. The
following is a snippet of an example log file created as a CSV:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image
    alt="CSV jMeter report"
    src="/static/images/jmeter/csv-results.png"
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

We see test run data displayed in a CSV file in the previous screenshot.

# Review

In review, we learned how to create a basic performance test using JMeter and BlazeMeter. Armed with the basic
Performance Testing knowledge and skills, we can now create more complex load profiles to test the performance of
applications in various scenarios.
