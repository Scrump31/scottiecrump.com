# Overview

[Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) is an open-sourced popular tool used to execute [Performance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing) for applications. If the success of your business weighs heavily on how well your application handles increased numbers of users, then Performance testing should be an essential piece of your testing strategy. For example, e-commerce websites typically experience large users during Black Friday sales. As a result, those businesses could lose millions of dollars if their applications lack the design to handle increased loads to complete sales transactions. This blog will cover the basics of using JMeter by designing and executing a test plan against a Computer database application. Next, we will review the application to test.

# Computer Database App Overview

The application we will use to execute Performance testing allows users to display filtered computers by name. Users can also add new computers or edit current computers. We will assess the application's responsiveness when many concurrent users complete actions to edit a computer.

# Overview of the Load Profile to Create

A load profile consists of the number of virtual users accessing an application, the operations completed, and their intensity while navigating the site. For example, the "edit a computer" operations our virtual users will execute consist of four steps:

- First, navigate to the site.
- Second, enter a computer name and click the "Filter by name" button.
- Third, select the computer to edit from the filtered list.
- Lastly, edit details and submit the form.
  We will test the application with 100 concurrent users for our test plan. In addition, we will add specific delays to requests to mimic real-life behaviors when users need time to think before completing actions. Also, we will assert the expected response code in the server's output. Finally, we will generate reports to analyze and understand how the application responded to the load.

# Installing JMeter

Before running tests with JMeter, we first need to install it. The Apache JMeter site provides [download instructions](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) for the latest version. You also need at least [Java version 8](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) installed on your machine to use JMeter. After installing JMeter, we can create and execute our test plan. Navigate to the **bin** folder where JMeter is installed and use `sh jmeter.sh` in the terminal to open JMeter. You can also create an [alias to open JMeter](https://loadfocus.com/blog/2021/06/how-to-create-an-alias-to-easily-start-jmeter-on-your-local-machine/#:~:text=Create%20an%20alias%20to%20the,1%2Fbin%2Fjmeter%22) using one command quickly from anywhere in your system. Finally, we can use an additional tool to lessen creating our test plan in JMeter. In the next section, we will learn how to use BlazeMeter to speed up building our JMeter test plan.

# Building The Test Plan with BlazeMeter

[BlazeMeter](https://www.blazemeter.com/) eases the creation of our test plan in JMeter by allowing you to record actions as you use the application in the browser and convert the outcome into a file that JMeter understands. To use BlazeMeter, first, install the associated [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blazemeter-the-continuous/mbopgmdnpcbohhpnfglgohlbhfongabi?hl=en) and create a free account. Next, log into your BlazeMeter account, start a recording session, navigate to the site in Chrome browsers, perform actions to create a new computer, save the recording as a JMX file, and finally, import the JMX file into JMeter.

[screenshot here]

In the previous screenshot, we see a snippet of BlazeMeter recording actions on the site in the browser. In the following sections, we will learn about the JMeter elements created by our recorded script using BlazeMeter.

## Understanding Thread Groups

[Thread Groups](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#thread_group) represent a specific number of users to access the software under test (SUT). BlazeMeter includes one user (i.e., thread) in the generated script by default. We will update the users to the desired number of 100. In addition, we will specify how often to add new threads every second using the **Ramp-up period**. We will use 10, meaning we will add ten users every second. Lastly, we configure the thread to run once by specifying the **Loop Count** as 1:

[screenshot here]

In the previous screenshot, we updated the number of concurrent users to 100, The Ramp-up to 10, and Loop Count to 1.

## Understanding Controllers

[Controllers](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#controllers) allow us to group requests in folders and can also be used to control the processing order of the request URLs we visit. There are various controllers we can use in JMeter based on needs. For example, BlazeMeter grouped our requests inside the **"Transaction Controller"** that we labeled as **"edit computer details."** The **"Transaction Controller"** adds an extra section to the test results, which measures the overall time to perform all requests nested in the folder:

[screenshot here]

In the previous screenshot, we see the **"Name"** and **"Comments"** fields and selected checkboxes for **"Generate parent sample"** and **"Include duration of timer and pre-post processors in generated sample."** By selecting **"Generate parent sample,"** the test results will only show the parent folder for all requests in the test results report versus displaying each request individually. By selecting **"Include duration of timer and pre-post processors in generated sample,"** test results will include artificially added time (e.g., think time) to the request via JMeter Timers. We will better understand the checkbox values in a later section in the blog.

## Understanding Samplers

[Samplers](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#samplers) represent the URL of the server you want to test. BlazeMeter automatically created samplers for every webpage we visited in the recording and labeled them with the URL used in the request. To make the samplers clear, we will edit the sampler names:

[screenshot here]

We edited all the sampler names in the previous screenshot to provide more context to the specific step. For the currently selected **"navigate to site"** sampler, notice the value `${BASE_URL_1}` for **"Server Name or IP"** inside the **"Web Server"** section of the **"HTTP Request"** window. The value is a variable created in the **"User Defined Variables"** added to our test plan by BlazeMeter. The **"User Defined Variables"** is an example of many **"Config Elements"** we can add to our Test plan.

[screenshot here]

In the previous screenshot, we see the **"Name"** and **"Value"** for our `${BASE_URL_1}` variable. The benefit of using a variable is that if the value ever changes, it only needs to be updated in one location versus every instance where the value is used. Also, inside the **"HTTP Request"** window, we can set many other values for the request. For example, we can set the request method with **"HTTP Request,"** the **"Path"** value, and even the HTTP protocol.

## Understanding Timers

When users interact with applications, it is customary to complete specific actions such as filling out sign up forms. The extra time needed to do particular activities is known as "think time." We can mimic think time in JMeter using [Timers](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#timers). The first JMeter timer we will add is "**Constant Time."** The **"Constant Timer"** executes a hard-coded delay before each request. For example, we can add a **"Constant Timer"** for the **"search for computer"** and **"select result"** samplers:

[add a screenshot here]

We added a **"Thread Delay"** of 1000 milliseconds (i.e., 1 second) for the two noted samplers in the previous screenshot. For the **"edit and save"** sampler, we will use the **"Uniform Random Timer."** The **"Uniform Random Timer"** allows you to add random delays to requests:

[add a screenshot here]

We added a **"Random Delay Maximum"** of 4000 milliseconds and a **"Constant Delay Offset"** of 1500 milliseconds in the previous screenshot. The values added mean there will be a delay between one and a half and four seconds before the sampler completes.

## Understanding Listeners

We need to create reports to analyze and understand the application's performance after test runs. JMeter provides many [listeners](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#listeners) to display test run data in various ways. The first listener we will add is **"View Results in Tree."** The **"View Results in Tree"** listener is suitable to view the request and response data while running JMeter via the graphical user interface (GUI):

[screenshot here]

We added the **"View Results in Tree"** listener in the previous screenshot. Note that the **"View Results in Tree"** listener is not ideal for production because it provides non-aggregated data, so remember to remove it before running JMeter via the command line. Next, we will add the **"Aggregated Results"** listener. The **"Aggregated Results"** listener is suitable to view essential performance data such as the average response time and throughput:

[screenshot here]

We added the **"Aggregated Results"** listener in the previous screenshot. The last listener we will add is **"Assertion Results."** The **"Assertion Results"** listener will display information related to any failing assertions we set for samplers:

[screenshot here]

In the previous screenshot, we added the **"Assertion Results"** listener.

## Adding Assertions

We can add [assertions](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#assertions) to verify expected responses from the server. For each request, we will confirm the response returns a 200 status code:

[screenshot here]

We added an assertion to each request in the previous screenshot verifying that the **"Response Code"** equals 200.

## Running the Test Plan from the Command-line

We can run JMeter tests via the GUI. However, it is best to run via the command line because the GUI consumes a lot of system memory, making tests run slowly. On a Mac or Linux machine, navigate to the **"bin"** folder where you have JMeter installed and use the following command to run JMeter:

```bash
sh jmeter.sh -n -t "location of your .jmx test file here" -l "location of the file to log results - ex. results.csv"
```

In the previous code snippet, we ran JMeter passing in parameters:

- `-n` means non-GUI mode
- `-t` means the path to test file
- `-l` means the location of the file to log the results

Note that the file used to log test results will automatically be created by JMeter if it does not already exist.

# Review

In review, we learned how to create a basic performance test using JMeter and BlazeMeter. Armed with the basic Performance Testing knowledge and skills, we can now create more complex load profiles to test the performance of applications in various scenarios.
