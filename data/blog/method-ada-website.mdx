# Overview

I recently created a blog alongside a coworker, [Daniel Flowers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-flowers-412a3664/), on accessible websites hosted on my employer, Method's website. In the blog, we discuss the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in areas such as public transportation and websites. We also list common accessibility issues for websites and tools that software teams can use to fix compliance issues.

You can read the blog in its entirety [here](https://www.method.com/insights/opening-the-web-to-everyone-building-ada-compliant-websites/) on Method's website.
