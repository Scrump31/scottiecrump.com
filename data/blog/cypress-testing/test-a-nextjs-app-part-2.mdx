# Install Cypress and eslint-plugin-cypress

In part two of the series, first, we will learn how to install Cypress using the following command:

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

Next, we will learn how to run Cypress against our application by creating the following npm script:

```bash
"cy:open": "cypress open"
```

In addition, we will also install and configure the eslint-plugin-cypress plugin to enforce best practices while using Cypress:

```bash
npm install eslint-plugin-cypress --save-dev
```

The following video illustrates the entire process:
