# Running Cypress in Multiple Browsers

In part six of the series, we will learn how to use the Cypress Test Runner to execute tests against various browsers such as Chrome and Edge. You can find the latest supported browsers [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Browsers).

The following video illustrates the entire process:
