# Intro
In today’s information technology-driven world, learning how to code has never been a more fantastic time. In my opinion, learning how to code prepares you for the future. More and more jobs in the future will require skills such as coding to maintain a competitive edge in the job market.

# Enhance Your Critical-Thinking Skills
Learning how to code enhances your ability to problem-solve. According to Steve Jobs, Co-founder of Apple Inc, “**learning how to code teaches you how to think.**” When you learn how to code, you approach problems analytically. It teaches you to think, “What do I already know about this problem?”, “What is the missing information I need to find?”, “What strategies do I already know to tackle this problem?”, “How can I use visuals to make this problem easier to understand?”, “What could I search on Google to help me figure out various parts of this problem?”, “How can I take this big problem and break it down into smaller parts?”.  You can apply critical thinking skills gained through learning how to code to any problem you may have, not just technology.

>I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think. I view computer science as a liberal art.
 — Steve Jobs

# Outstanding Job-Market
It’s not a given that learning how to code means you need to find a job as a [Web Developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer), but it does pay well, and there is a high job demand. “Employment for web developers is projected to grow 13 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. The demand will be driven by the growing popularity of mobile devices and e-commerce.” — [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm) According to [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Computer-Programmer-Salaries), the average U.S. salary for a Computer Programmer is $67,000. There are many other exciting, growing career options, such as [Quality Assurance Analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_assurance_analyst), [Web Designer](https://www.sokanu.com/careers/web-designer/), or [Server Side Developer](https://www.thebalance.com/the-skills-you-need-to-be-a-backend-developer-2071184).

# Build Tools To Self-Solve Problems
When you learn how to code, you can take ideas and turn them into reality. For example, you could build an app to sell in the Apple or Google Play store. You could start your blog and share your opinions with anyone looking for new knowledge or inspiration. You could think about a tedious, repetitive task at your current job and figure out an automated solution using code to free up more time.

# Prepare Children For The Future
As technology continues to grow, future jobs will increase the demand for technology-related skills for employment candidates. We’re already at the point where you’re a step behind the job search if you’re not using sites like [Linkedin](http://linkedin.com/) to demonstrate your skills to potential employers. I remember a scene from the movie, [The Social Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network), where the President at Harvard made a great statement. The President stated that Harvard graduates don’t come here to learn what company they will work for when they graduate, but *what company they will start themselves*. I think promoting this mindset in school-aged children is the way to go. Introducing a skill like coding is a great way to start.

# Conclusion
To conclude, there is always a need to continue learning and developing new skills to keep up with the ever-changing advancements in technology to make our lives easier. Since 2018 and those new year's resolutions are coming soon, why not add "**Learn how to build a static website by the end of the year**" as one of your goals? Who knows, maybe you'll take a great idea and build a product that will have you on the next season of Shark Tank.
